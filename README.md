# Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks-KANs-mlx

Rudimentary implementation of the efficient KAN https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan using the mlx framework. Feel free to optimize for speed as I don't have a lot of time to work on this or implement other types of neural networks. For example there are CNNS made with KANS like this https://github.com/AntonioTepsich/Convolutional-KANs and so on.

You should have mlx installed (pip install mlx).
Basic usage - python training.py.
